### CI Failures - Hypothesis

Given that we have 15 packages with failing R-CMD-check from the original analysis:

**Most likely causes (in order):**
1. README-vignette code mismatch (the main issue we're fixing)
2. Vignette rendering errors (markdown syntax, missing chunks)
3. Missing dependencies in DESCRIPTION
4. Test failures (data quality checks)

**Action Plan:**
1. Check which packages from the CI failure list have README/vignette issues
2. Prioritize fixes based on simplicity (syntax errors first)
3. Commit legitimate work (graduation features, documentation)
4. Clean build artifacts
5. Run CI checks and fix remaining issues
